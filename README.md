# JS-DataStructure
Collection of Data Structure concepts, implemented using Javascript.

## Stack
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

### Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack:

| Method        | Description           |
| ------------- |-----------------------|
| push          | Adds an item in the stack at end |
| pop           | Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed.|
| peek/top      | Returns top element of stack   |
| isEmpty       | Returns true if stack is empty.  |
| printStack    | Returns entire stack  |
